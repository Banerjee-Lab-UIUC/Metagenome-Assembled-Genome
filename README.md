# Metagenome-Assembled-Genome
Software required of MAG construction and downstream analysis
Here we have constructed Metagenome Assembled genome (MAG) from shotgun sequencing data. We have used a series of different software /packages for read quality check, processing, host contamination removal, MAG construction and downstream pathway analysis. We gave provided the link for each software which will help you to understand the detail operation and expected output for each step.
